# Traffic-sign-recognition

The project "Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN" is a noteworthy endeavor that applies artificial intelligence technology to enhance traffic safety. Recognizing and understanding traffic signs play a crucial role in guiding drivers and vehicle operators, and utilizing the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model provides an effective and accurate approach to address this challenge.

CNN is a machine learning model designed based on the human visual system. It employs convolutional and pooling layers to automatically learn important features from image data. The project focuses on training the CNN model with a large dataset containing various traffic signs, including prohibitory signs, warning signs, regulatory signs, and many others.

Through the training process, the model learns to recognize and classify traffic signs based on their unique features such as shape, color, and symbols. When deployed in real-world scenarios, the CNN model will have the capability to autonomously classify and identify traffic signs in real-time. This plays a crucial role in providing accurate information about traffic signs to drivers and vehicle operators, enabling them to comply with traffic rules safely and efficiently.

The Traffic Sign Recognition project using CNN has the potential to be integrated into smart transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and mobile applications, creating a safer, more convenient, and intelligent traffic environment. Utilizing this technology will help minimize traffic accidents, enhance adherence to traffic regulations, and improve the quality of life in communities.
